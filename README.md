#### JavaBuzz (FizzBuzz)

We were introduced to Javascript in Week 5 of Makers Academy. In order to learn a new language and test myself, I re-wrote the FizzBuzz program I had previously written in Ruby, in Javascript!

## Rules of FizzBuzz

* Print the numbers from 1 to 100
* If a number is divisible by 3 print "Fizz" instead
* If a number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz" instead
* If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz" instead

## Running the Program

1. Clone this repo
2. Run 'open SpecRunner.html' from the command line.
3. In the same window where SpecRunner.html is loaded up, open your console (you will need Google Chrome - the shortcut is cmd + option + i).
4. At the prompt, initialise an instance of Fizzbuzz(); as follows:

```
var fizzbuzz = new Fizzbuzz();
```

5. Give it some numbers! :)

```
>  fizzbuzz.says(3)
<- "Fizz"

>  fizzbuzz.says(5)
<- "Buzz"

>  fizzbuzz.says(15)
<- "FizzBuzz"

>  fizzbuzz.says(1)
<- 1
```
